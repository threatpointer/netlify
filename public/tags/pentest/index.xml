      <description>Background I have been planning to kick off my blog for sometime now and has just not happened, until now. I intend to share my experiences and notes mostly i take while I learn something. My first blog is about an article I wrote for PenTest Magazine for their PowerShell edition, published in January 2016.
PowerShell has been around for quite some time now. Taking humble steps, from a downloadable edition of PowerShell v1.</description>
